# Day 3: Prompt Engineering—Patterns That Work

## Overview
Day 3 is all about prompt engineering. Learn how different prompt patterns can guide LLMs to produce better, more relevant outputs.

## What You'll Learn
- Why prompt engineering matters
- Common prompt patterns: role assignment, step-by-step, few-shot
- How prompt structure affects LLM output

## Demo
The Python script `prompt_patterns.py` demonstrates:
- Three prompt patterns for code generation
- Comparing outputs from each pattern using OpenAI API (or HuggingFace for open-source)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python code/prompt_patterns.py
   ```

## Diagram
A hand-drawn style diagram visualizes:
- Three prompt boxes → LLM → Three different outputs

## Reflection
Prompt patterns are like recipes—experimenting leads to better results. Try different patterns and see what works for you!
