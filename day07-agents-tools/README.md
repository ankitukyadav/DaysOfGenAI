# Day 7: Agents & Function Callingâ€”Making LLMs Interactive

## Overview
Explores agents and function calling, enabling LLMs to interact with tools and APIs for dynamic GenAI apps.

## What You'll Learn
- What agents are in GenAI
- How to simulate function calling with Python
- How agents reason and act

## Demo
The Python script `function_calling_agent.py` demonstrates:
- Defining functions for the agent to call
- Simulating agent reasoning based on user queries
- Fallback to LLM for general questions

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the script.
3. Run the script:
python code/function_calling_agent.py
