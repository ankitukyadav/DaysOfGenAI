# Day 9: Orchestrators—LangChain & LlamaIndex in Action

## Overview
Day 9 explores orchestrators—frameworks for building and managing GenAI workflows. LangChain and LlamaIndex are featured.

## What You'll Learn
- What orchestrators do in GenAI
- How to build a retrieval-augmented QA pipeline with LangChain
- How to connect LLMs to external data

## Demo
The Python script `langchain_qa.py` demonstrates:
- Creating a vector store with FAISS
- Building a QA chain with LangChain
- Answering questions using retrieval and LLMs

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain faiss-cpu openai
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the script.
3. Run the script:
python code/langchain_qa.py
