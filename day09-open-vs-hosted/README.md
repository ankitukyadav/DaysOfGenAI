# Day 10: Open-source vs Hosted LLM APIs—Which Should You Choose?

## Overview
Day 10 compares open-source LLMs (like Llama) with hosted APIs (like OpenAI), helping you choose the best fit for your project.

## What You'll Learn
- Pros and cons of open-source vs hosted LLMs
- How to run text generation with both approaches
- Key decision factors for developers

## Demo
The Python script `llm_comparison.py` demonstrates:
- Generating text with HuggingFace’s Llama (open-source)
- Generating text with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (hosted API)
- Comparing outputs side by side

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers openai
2. Add your OpenAI API key to the script.
3. Run the script:
python code/llm_comparison.py
