# Day 19: Mini-Projectâ€”Evals on Synthetic Data for GenAI

## Overview
Day 19 is a mini-project: generate synthetic data, run LLM evals, and measure performance.

## What You'll Learn
- How to generate and use synthetic data for GenAI evals
- How to benchmark LLM accuracy
- Why synthetic data is useful for safe experimentation

## Demo
The Python script `synthetic_eval.py` demonstrates:
- Generating synthetic Q&A pairs
- Running LLM answers and evaluating accuracy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
2 Add your OpenAI API key to the script.
3 Run the script
