# Day 20: Multi-Agent Orchestrationâ€”LLMs Working Together

## Overview
Day 20 explores multi-agent orchestration: using multiple LLM agents to collaborate and solve complex tasks.

## What You'll Learn
- Why multi-agent systems matter for GenAI
- How to orchestrate retrieval and reasoning agents
- How to simulate agent collaboration in Python

## Demo
The Python script `multi_agent_demo.py` demonstrates:
- A retrieval agent fetching context
- A reasoning agent generating an answer
- Orchestrating both for a final response

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
2 Add your OpenAI API key to the script.
3 Run the script
