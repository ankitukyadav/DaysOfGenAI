# Day 21: Building with LangChainâ€”Hands-on GenAI Pipelines

## Overview
Day 21 is a hands-on intro to LangChain: build a simple RAG pipeline for question answering.

## What You'll Learn
- How to use LangChain for GenAI workflows
- How to build a retrieval-augmented QA pipeline
- How to connect LLMs and vector stores

## Demo
The Python script `langchain_rag_demo.py` demonstrates:
- Creating a vector store with FAISS
- Building a QA chain with LangChain
- Answering questions using retrieval and LLMs

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain faiss-cpu openai
